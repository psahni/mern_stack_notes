What is state - memory of a component


Lets say const x = 10 -> Is it a state of the component?
My ans - yes it is, but functional comp primary purpose is to display the  content, now if you want to bring react state into it, on updating which you want to re-render the component, then you need to bring hooks into it.  Bring state management. Hooks attach the state to lifecycle of component.
