### Never
A function that never finishes running

```js
const neverStop = (): never => {
  while(true) {
    console.log("I am still going");
  }
}
```

* Void returns null or void

```

let coordinate: {x: number, y} = {x:3, y:2}

```

```
printName({first: "Mick", last: "Jagger"}) // You can't pass any more property

```
For that you need to save in separate variable.

```js

const singer = { first: "Mick", last: "Jagger", age: 30 }

printName(singer)

```
