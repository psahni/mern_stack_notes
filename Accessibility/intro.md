### Definition

Accessibility in front-end development refers to the practice of creating websites and applications that are usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities.
This encompasses a range of impairments, including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities.
Ensuring accessibility is not just a technical requirement; it promotes inclusivity and allows all users to interact with digital content effectively.

### Accessibility Checklist

✅ Semantic HTML
✅ Keyboard navigable
✅ Screen reader compatible
✅ Sufficient color contrast
✅ Form field labels
✅ Alternative text for images
✅ ARIA attributes where needed

### Importance of Accessibility

_Inclusivity:_ Accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access online information, services, and opportunities equally. By prioritizing accessibility, developers contribute to a more equitable digital space23.

_User Experience:_ Implementing accessibility features enhances the overall user experience for everyone. For instance, captions on videos benefit not only those who are hard of hearing but also users in noisy environments34.

Legal Compliance: Many countries have laws requiring compliance with accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Adhering to these standards helps avoid legal issues and fosters a positive brand reputation

### Key Principles of Accessibility

- Semantic HTML

  Using semantic HTML elements (like `<button>` for buttons and `<input>` for forms) ensures that assistive technologies can interpret the content correctly.
  Also easy for screen readers

- Keyboard Navigation
  All interactive elements should be navigable using a keyboard alone. This is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse. Developers should ensure that elements receive focus in a logical order and that all functionalities can be activated via keyboard shortcuts (e.g., using the Tab key to navigate and Enter to activate)

- Color Contrast
  Maintaining adequate color contrast between text and background is essential for readability, especially for users with visual impairments

- Descriptive Links and Alt Text
  Links should be descriptive enough to convey their purpose without additional context (e.g., "Read more about dinosaurs" instead of "Read more"). Similarly, images should have meaningful alt text that describes their content or function.

- Testing and Continuous Improvement
  Regular testing with accessibility tools (such as Lighthouse or WAVE) helps identify and rectify issues throughout the development process. It is an ongoing effort.

### Pointers about Keyboard navigation

- Add event listeners to 'enter' or 'space'
- Use CSS to ensure that the current focus element is visually distinct.
- Structure your HTML so that the tab order follows a logical sequence that matches the visual layout of the page. Avoid using positive tabindex values, which can disrupt the natural flow; instead, use tabindex="0" for elements that should be focusable
- Users should be easily able to move away from elements, he should not get trapped while navigating via keyboard
- When modal is opened, focus should be only on that. Avoid user clicking outside of modal
- Create keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Keyboard Traps

- Modal should have 'cancel' or 'close' button
- For controls like dropdown, ensure that users are able to navigate away (Tab or Escape)
- Be cautious with JavaScript event handlers like onBlur, onFocus, or onChange
- When dynamically updating content on the page (like loading new sections via AJAX), ensure that focus is appropriately managed. If focus does not shift to the new content, users may find themselves trapped in an area of the page that no longer reflects their intended navigation path
- Navigate all options in Dropdown menus
- Focus Management: Allow users to go back to prev states
