
1. Micro Frontend Architecture: Modularize large applications, allowing independent teams to work on distinct parts of a project.

2. Web Vitals Optimization: 
Fine-tune FCP, LCP, and CLS metrics to improve performance and user experience.

3. Edge Rendering & SSR Optimization: Use edge networks and server-side rendering for faster, location-based responses.

4. Design Systems & Component Libraries: 
Implement reusable UI components at scale with tools like Storybook and design tokens.

5. Monorepo Management: 
Organize and manage complex codebases with tools like Nx or Turborepo.

6. Progressive Web App (PWA) techniques:
Use service workers, offline caching, and background sync for richer, faster experiences.

7. Advanced State Management: Master global state solutions, context isolation, and lazy-loaded reducers (e.g., Redux Toolkit).

8. Security Practices: Implement CSP, secure authentication, and mitigate vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF.

9. Advanced Testing Frameworks: Use component-level testing, visual regression, and integration tests with Cypress or Playwright.

10. Automated CI/CD Pipelines: Integrate front-end pipelines with testing, bundling, and deployment automation
