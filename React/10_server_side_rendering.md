### Server Side rendering

* Data intensive apps
* SEO


* React components are rendered on the server side. If you go to page source, you will see rendered content appended to the html body, while this is not the case for client side components.

* Useful in case of SEO, since web crawler sees your rendered component

* `use-client`, in case you want to render the component on the client. For example - Image slider
